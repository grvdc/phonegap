        "q":"What is lead?",
        "a":"<p>Lead is a toxic metal that was used for many years in products found in and around our homes. Lead also can be emitted into the air from motor vehicles and industrial sources, and lead can enter drinking water from plumbing materials. Lead-based paint is present in many homes built before 1978.The federal government banned the use of lead-based paint in housing in 1978.

        "q": "Where is lead found?",
        "a": "<p>Many homes built before 1978 have lead-based paint. In general, the older your home, the more likely it has lead-based paint. Soil around a home can contain lead from sources like deteriorated exterior paint, past use of leaded gas in cars, or from past renovation activities. Household dust can pick up lead from deteriorating lead-based paint, from past renovation projects, or from soil tracked into a home. If you work with lead, you could bring it home on your hands or clothes. It is important to shower and change clothes before going home. Launder your work clothes separately from the rest of your family's clothes.

'Housing units” include single-family homes, manufactured housing, and multi-unit dwellings like apartments. Vacant housing, group quarters (e.g., prisons, hospitals, and dormitories), hotels, motels, and other short-term housing, military bases, and housing where children are not permitted to live (e.g., housing designated exclusively for the elderly and those with zero-bedroom units) are not included in this number.

For example, 87% of homes built before 1940 have some lead-based paint, while 24% of homes built between 1960 and 1978 have some lead-based paint. Lead-based paint may be present in private single-family homes or apartments, government-assisted, or public housing, and in urban, suburban, or rural settings. If you want to know whether or not your home contains lead-based paint, EPA recommends one of the following:</p><ul><li>Assume your home contains lead-based paint and take the appropriate precautions. In pre-1978 homes and buildings, this is the simplest and safest approach.</li><li>Hire a certified professional to check for lead-based paint. A certified lead-based paint inspector or risk assessor can conduct an inspection to determine whether your home or a portion of your home has lead-based paint and where it is located. This will tell you the areas in your home where lead-safe work practices should be used for renovation, repair, or painting jobs. A certified risk assessor can conduct a risk assessment telling you whether your home currently has any lead hazards from lead in paint, dust, or soil. The risk assessor can also tell you what actions to take to address any hazards. For help finding a certified risk assessor or inspector, call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD (5323).</li></ul><p>A number of lead test kits are available for consumer purchase in most retail hardware stores, however, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) states that consumers should exercise caution when using these lead test kits to evaluate consumer products for potential lead exposures.

Specifically, the certified renovator must prepare a record that states the brand of lead test kit used or the name and address of the EPA-recognized laboratory performing the paint chip analysis, a description of the components tested including their location, and results of the tests. The certified renovator’s firm must retain a copy of this record for three years.

EPA is required by law to charge firms a fee that covers the government’s cost of administering the program. Firm certification is valid for five years. The fee for most firms is <b>$300</b>, which is equivalent to a cost of <b>$60 per year</b>.</p><p>In addition, the rule requires that firms use trained certified renovators for certain key parts of the job, such as containing the work area and conducting cleaning verification after the job’s completion. In most cases, firms have at least one certified renovator on staff. To be a certified renovator, an individual must take a training course from a private training provider accredited by EPA. The training is valid for five years. The cost of the training course is set by the private training provider and varies, but averages $186 (which is equivalent to a cost of about $40 per year). The trained renovators can then provide on-the-job training to their workers. Firms may also incur additional costs related to training and certification, such as the time spent on the activities, and for traveling to and from the training. EPA estimates that this costs $562 per person trained. This includes a tuition cost of $186, the value of time for the eight hours the renovator is in class ($253), the value of time for two hours traveling to and from class ($63), mileage costs to drive to and from the training ($49), and lunch while at the training ($9).</p> <p>Costs Associated with Lead-Safe Work Practices: Aside from the fixed costs for training and certification, renovators will also incur costs that vary depending on the size, type, and number of jobs performed.</p> <p>Lead test kits. Renovators may choose to use lead test kits to determine whether lead-based paint is present before the start of the job. The total cost of the lead test kits used depends on the number components tested, but is estimated to average $10 per job. The use of lead test kits is optional, but many renovators find the lead test kits helpful for determining which parts of the job are subject to the rule’s work practice requirements</p> <p>Labor, equipment and supply costs. The rule also requires renovators to use work practices in order to reduce exposure to lead dust. As part of the rulemaking process, EPA estimated the labor, equipment, and supply costs for these work practices. To calculate the costs for the rule’s containment, cleaning, and cleaning verification requirements, EPA considered nine categories of renovation events (kitchen renovation, window replacement, painting, etc), for up to three sizes (small, medium, and large square footage) in up to three different dwelling types (single-family owner, single family rental, and multi-family rental) and in child-occupied facilities.</p> <p>EPA first estimated an absolute cost of complying with the lead-safe work practices required by a rule if a renovator did not use any containment, or perform any cleaning, or cleaning verification prior to the rule. EPA estimated the labor and materials costs associated with each lead-safe work practice for the various job types included in the analysis.</p> <p>However, EPA heard from the industry that renovators had been taking steps to control dust from renovations prior to the promulgation of the rule. Based on this input, EPA estimated an average incremental cost of each lead-safe work practice by subtracting the cost already being incurred by renovators for containment and cleaning from the estimate of the absolute cost of the rule’s requirements</p> <p>For typical jobs in single family homes, EPA estimated that the average absolute costs to comply with the rule ranged from $35 to $376, depending on the size and nature of the job. The average incremental costs of complying with the rule ranged from $8 to $124. For example:</p><p>For a large window replacement job in a single-family home (12 windows), the average cost ranges between $124 for contractors who already used some of the required work practices, to $376 for contractors who did not use any of the required work practices.</p><p>For a medium sized job removing portions of a wall in a single-family home (such as might be done to repair water pipes or electrical wiring), the average cost ranges between $41 for contractors who already used some of the required work practices, to $121 for contractors who did not use any of the required work practices.</p><p>For an exterior painting job involving four exterior walls, the average cost ranges between $90 for contractors who already used some of the required work practices, to $245 for contractors who did not use any of the required work practices.</p><p>Finally, firms incur a cost for paperwork and recordkeeping, in order to demonstrate compliance with the RRP rule’s training and work practice requirements.</p><p>Renovators conduct millions of jobs each year, ranging from simple drywall repairs to complete kitchen and bath renovations, and from window replacements to building additions. While EPA estimated the compliance costs for various general sizes and types of work, EPA’s cost model is a simplified representation that cannot capture all of the variations from one job to another. EPA’s methodology does not estimate the cost for any individual job performed by a particular renovator.</p><p>The cost for a particular contractor to comply with the rule may be considerably different from the sample jobs EPA considered, depending on factors such as the size, configuration, or other conditions of the work area; how the contractor uses his or her discretion to comply with the rule; and the prevailing local wage rates. Furthermore, EPA only estimated the cost of the work practices required by the rule. Some contractors may choose to take additional precautions beyond those required by the rule. These steps may provide extra protection for residents and renovation workers, but they also increase the cost of the work. And because EPA’s estimates reflect the cost to contractors, not the price paid by homeowners, the estimates do not include the contractor’s mark-up for profits.</p></p><p>The purpose of EPA’s analysis was to compare the national cost of the rule’s requirements to the national benefits of the rule. The analysis indicated that the requirements of the rule are not excessive or overly burdensome in light of the importance of avoiding the potentially severe consequences of exposure to lead-based paint hazards.</p>"

Of course, the asbestos abatement must be designed and conducted by persons accredited in accordance with the Model Accreditation Plan.</p><p>The asbestos abatement will need to meet the RRP Rule work practice standards as well as the standards for asbestos abatement. For each element of the job, the contractor will need to determine which standards are more stringent and comply with those standards. Typically, the asbestos abatement containment and waste handling requirements are more stringent than the RRP Rule provisions, so compliance with the asbestos requirements will also serve as compliance with the RRP requirements.

Even if an entire window measures less than 6 square feet, the replacement of any size window is a renovation, not minor repair and maintenance, because it is specifically excluded from the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance.” Similarly, because torch burning is prohibited by 745.85(a)(3), no activity involving torch burning can be considered minor repair and maintenance. For the purposes of the definition of minor repair and maintenance, EPA considers demolition to be an activity that removes or otherwise disrupts a painted component in a way that destroys or ruins the component.</p><p>The definition of 'minor repair and maintenance” provides some guidance on how to measure the surface disrupted: 'When removing painted components, or portions of painted components, the entire surface area removed is the amount of painted surface disturbed.” In other cases, when painted surfaces are being disturbed or disrupted, but not completely removed, the disrupted surface area is the area being actively disturbed. For example, when spot sanding to prepare a surface for painting, the area of the surface that was actually sanded is the surface area disrupted.</p><p>Finally, the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance” states that 'jobs, other than emergency renovations, performed in the same room within the same 30 days must be considered the same job for the purpose of determining whether the job is a minor repair and maintenance activity.” Therefore, sanding 5 square feet of paint in the same room on two different days within the same 30 day period must be considered the same job, which would be a renovation because it does not meet the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance.”</p>"

        "a": "<p>Generally, a certified renovator using an EPA-recognized test kit must test each building component to be disturbed. The only exception to this requirement is when the components make up an integrated whole. In such a case, one or more component(s) may represent a system of components, unless it is obvious to the renovator that the components have been repainted or refinished separately.</p><p>A staircase, for example, is made up of numerous repeating components which can be grouped together as integrated wholes for testing purposes. For these purposes, staircase components can be grouped into the following integrated wholes: (1) treads and risers, (2) balustrades, (3) newel posts, (4) railing caps, and (5) stringers. A single individual staircase component (e.g., a baluster) may represent the remaining staircase components of the same group (i.e., the rest of the balustrades on the staircase) unless it is obvious to the renovator that the components have been repainted or refinished separately. Therefore, where an entire staircase is to be disturbed, EPA believes it will be necessary to test five surfaces: one tread or riser, one balustrade, one newel post, one railing cap, and one exposed stringer. So long as it is not obvious that the components have been repainted or refinished separately, a negative test for lead-based paint on an individual staircase component in each of these groups would mean that a renovation on that particular staircase could be performed without regard to the RRP work practices.</p><p>EPA also believes it appropriate to apply the integrated whole concept to windows and doors. For testing purposes, window and door components can be grouped into the following integrated wholes: (1) the window or door assembly and (2) the window or door trim. Window assembly components include the sashes, stops, head, jambs, sill or stool, and trough; door assembly components include the door slab(s), jambs, head, sill and threshold. As a practical matter, it is likely that interior and exterior surfaces of window and door assemblies were repainted or refinished separately and should be tested separately. Therefore, where both the window/door assembly and trim will be disturbed (e.g., a full-frame window/door replacement), EPA believes that it will be necessary to test four surfaces: one interior window/door assembly component, one interior window/door trim, one exterior window/door assembly component, and one exterior window/door trim. However, if you only disturb paint on the interior or exterior of a window then you only need to test the assembly and trim on that side. If it is not obvious that the components have been repainted or refinished separately, a negative test for lead-based paint on a component in each of these groups would mean that a renovation on that particular window or door could be performed without regard to the RRP work practices.</p><p>NOTE: Each window, door and staircase to be disturbed must be separately tested, even if in the same room. Also, negative testing results must still be documented in accordance with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 745.86(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 745.86(a) and (c).

        "a": "<p>Emergency renovations are those performed in response to situations necessitating immediate action to address safety or public health hazards or threats of significant damage to equipment and/or property. The need for immediate action relieves firms from the pre-renovation education requirements. Likewise, emergency renovations are exempt from the warning sign, containment, waste handling, training, and certification requirements to the extent necessary to respond to the emergency. The cleaning, cleaning verification, and recordkeeping requirements still apply.</p><p>Once the portion of the repair that addresses the source of the emergency is completed, however, the justification for the exemption from the rule is no longer operative; therefore, any additional renovation activity needed to return the renovation work area to its pre-emergency condition would be subject to the requirements of the rule.

For example, most property management companies that do their own maintenance are likely to have at least one trained and certified renovator on staff to perform renovations, so these companies should be able to comply with the training and certification requirements on all renovations.

        "a": "<p>EPA notes that \"renovation\" under the rule is defined, in general, as the modification of any existing structure, or portion thereof, that results in the disturbance of painted surfaces. Thus, if all the paint disturbing activities on a job have been completed before July 6, 2010, even though the job itself isn’t finished, the requirements of the rule would not be triggered. Generally, on or after July 6, 2010, activities that disturb painted surfaces must be performed in accordance with the work practice standards and training requirements of the Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule. EPA believes that it is important that you minimize exposure of your clients and their family to lead-paint dust. However, EPA recognizes that in some cases it may be infeasible for a renovator with an opt-out to stage a project in a manner that ensures completion of paint disturbing activities prior to July 6, 2010. In such circumstances of infeasibility, EPA believes that renovators should be able to conclude paint disturbing activities with the benefit of the opt-out even if the work continues briefly after July 6.

Breaks, such as those for summer or winter, are mere temporary disruptions in regular visits by children.</p><p>To provide the required information to the parents and guardian of children using the child-occupied facility, a firm must either (1) mail or hand deliver the pamphlet and the renovation information to each parent or guardian of a child using the child-occupied facility or (2) post informational signs describing the general nature and locations of the renovation and the anticipated completion date. These signs must be posted in areas where they can be seen by the parents or guardians of the children. The signs must also be accompanied by a posted copy of the pamphlet or information on how interested parents or guardians can obtain a free copy from the renovation firm.</p>"

        "q": "I regularly perform renovations and repairs to common areas in a large apartment complex. Must I provide separate notice to the tenants for each one of these activities or is there any way to avoid such duplication?",
        "a": "<p>EPA recognizes that neither residents nor owners/managers/renovators are well-served if duplicative notifications are frequently issued for similar renovation activities. There are several options owners/managers/renovators may use to most efficiently provide residents in both single-family and multi-family housing with the necessary information.</p><p>(A) Informational Signs – Owners/managers/renovators may provide notice of renovation activities in common areas to affected tenants by posting signs. Signs must be posted while the renovation is ongoing and they must describe the general nature and locations of the renovation and the anticipated completion date. These signs must be posted in areas where they are likely to be seen by the occupants of all of the affected units. The signs must be accompanied by a posted copy of the 'Renovate Right” pamphlet or information on how interested occupants can review a copy of the pamphlet or obtain a copy from the renovation firm at no cost to the occupants.</p><p>(B) Category Notices – When renovation activities fall within distinct categories which are performed on a cyclical or recurring basis (e.g., hallway painting), they may be grouped into a single notice which describes the categories and provides a description of the locations affected. To fulfill the requirement for providing timing information for the renovations, owners/managers/renovators may either list the expected starting and ending dates, or employ one of the other methods for meeting the timing requirements described below.</p><p>(C) Bi-monthly Notices – Section 745.84(a) of the RRP Rule requires that notifications be given no more than 60 days before renovation activities begin. To minimize the number of notices required, owners/managers/renovators may group all of the renovation activities expected to occur over a 60-day period into a single notice distributed bi-monthly (every other month). Renovation activities which were expected to occur within a given 60-day period, but which were canceled or postponed, would simply be addressed in the subsequent bimonthly notice. Including renovation notices in, or as an attachment to, a pre-existing newsletter is acceptable provided that the cover of the newsletter prominently indicates that lead-based paint renovation notices are contained in or attached to the newsletter.</p><p>Descriptions of Renovation Timing -- Section 745.84(b)(2) of the RRP Rule requires that notices contain the 'expected starting and ending dates” of the proposed common area renovations. Although providing specific dates is preferable wherever possible, the Agency is aware that unexpected events or circumstances often result in delays and/or cancellations of planned renovation activities. To provide sufficient flexibility without unduly compromising residents’ rights to information on the timing of renovations in common areas, owners/managers/renovators may employ the following terminology to address the following timing scenarios to avoid the needing to issue supplemental notices:</p><p>'On or about” -- acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs one week before or after the date given.</p><p>'Early [insert month name]” – acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs during the first half of the specified month.</p><p>'Late [insert month name]” -- acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs during the second half of the specified month.</p><p>'Ongoing for the 12-month period beginning [insert month name]” – acceptable when the renovation commences within 60 days of the issuance of the notice and continues throughout the 12-month period. If an interruption of more than 60 days occurs any time after commencement of such activity, a new notice will be required before the activity may restart.</p><p>Descriptions of Renovation Ending Dates – Due to the inherent difficulties in estimating the duration of many renovation activities, owners/managers/renovators are encouraged to make allowances for unexpected delays when providing descriptions of ending days under Section 745.84(b)(2) of the RRP Rule. Any estimated ending date with a rational basis is acceptable.</p>"

        "q": "Must notifications for common area renovations always be provided to every unit in a multifamily housing complex?",
        "a": "<p>Not necessarily. When renovations are to be performed in common areas of multi-family housing (i.e., those portions of the property generally accessible to all residents/users), the RRP Rule requires that each 'affected unit” be notified in writing. See 745.84(b)(2). As a general matter, all units in the housing are 'affected unit(s)” and therefore must be provided with notice of a common area renovation.</p><p>However, in a minority of cases, certain areas of a property that meet the definition of common area may in fact be used almost exclusively by an identifiable subset of tenants. For example, a common area inside one building of a multi-building apartment complex is likely to be used exclusively by tenants of only that building. See FQ 23002-19756. If a renovation is to be performed on such a common area, EPA believes it appropriate to provide notice only to the truly affected units: the subset of tenant users.</p><p>Firms may notify residents/users either by distributing written notice to each affected unit or by posting informational signs. Signs must be posted while the renovation is ongoing and they must describe the general nature and locations of the renovation and the anticipated completion date. These signs must be posted in areas where they are likely to be seen by the occupants of all of the affected units.

        "a": "<p>Yes. Property managers are acting in the capacity of agents for the building owners. For this reason, a property manager may receive, and acknowledge receipt of, the lead hazard pamphlet on behalf of the owner.</p><p>In situations where property managers or their employees are performing the renovations themselves, they are acting both as a 'firm performing the renovation” and as agents for the owner.

A common area is a portion of a building that is generally accessible to all residents/users. Thus, if the work area established to contain dust and debris from the renovation activity is entirely within the confines of the private balcony, then the renovation is not generally accessible to residents/users, not within a common area, and therefore not subject to the common area notification requirements. However, if the work area is not entirely within the confines of the balcony (e.g., the renovation will result in the release of dust, paint chips, or other construction debris to the ground beneath the balcony), the firm must comply with the pre-renovation education requirements for common area renovations.</p>"

If mailbox delivery is used, both hand delivery and delivery via U.S. mail are acceptable; however, U.S. mail deliveries must be sent 7 days prior to the commencement of renovations and documented with a certificate of mailing.</p><p>As a practical matter, it may be easier or more efficient to provide notice of renovations in multi-family housing common areas by posting signs. Signs must be posted while the renovation is ongoing and describe the general nature and locations of the renovation and the anticipated completion date. These signs must be posted in areas where they are likely to be seen by the occupants of all of the affected units.

To qualify for this exclusion, however, the work site must be in an area which is enclosed by a wall, fence, or other permanent or temporary physical barrier which truly prevents access by tenants and other building users. Rope, tape lines, pylons, and similar work area designation devices which can be easily surmounted or bypassed are not acceptable barriers for this purpose.</p>"

        "a": "<p>Personal delivery of the lead information pamphlet is preferable, wherever possible, because EPA believes that tenants will be more likely to read the information if it is handed directly to them. It also affords tenants an opportunity to raise concerns and ask questions about the renovation. EPA recognizes, however, that personal delivery will not always be a viable option, especially when a renovation needs to be commenced on short notice and an adult occupant of the apartment is not available. Thus, the RRP Rule permits the person delivering the pamphlet to 'self-certify” the delivery (40 C.F.R. 745.84(a)(2)(i)).

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has requirements for personal protective equipment, EPA does not. For many years, EPA has recommended the use of personal protective equipment as a way to protect workers and to help ensure that leaded dust and debris does not leave renovation or abatement work sites. EPA recommends that renovators make use of the minimum respiratory protection recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for environments where lead is present, but respiratory protection is not required by the EPA regulations. In addition, disposable clothing, if removed and disposed of before the workers leave the work site, can provide additional protection for workers’ families by ensuring that no leaded dust or debris is carried home on worker clothing. However, EPA does not require this and allows renovators to use other methods to ensure that dust and debris does not leave the work area, including the HEPA vacuuming of clothing, tools, and other items before they leave the work area.</p>"

If the vertical containment is set up at a distance of less than ten feet from the work surface, must we still extend the ground containment beyond the vertical barrier to meet the ten-foot requirement?",
      "a":"<p>The work practices for exterior projects are based on a performance standard -- the work area must be contained so that dust or debris does not leave the work area while the renovation is being performed. EPA recognizes that proper use of exterior vertical containment measures may be a more effective method for containing the work area than use of the traditional ground containment alone, as outlined in the regulations.</p><p>With proper techniques, a firm may meet the performance standard by using vertical containment in conjunction with ground containment. Vertical containment means a vertical barrier consisting of plastic sheeting or other impermeable material over scaffolding or a rigid frame, or an equivalent system of containing the work area (40 CFR § 745.83). Properly constructed vertical containment, for example, might consist of a rigid box-like framework wrapped in impermeable plastic sheeting and anchored to the ground and home. When placed on top of ground containment, such containment should effectively limit the travel of dust and debris to the interior of the enclosure. Whatever construction techniques are used, the containment must completely isolate the work area and prevent any dust and debris from leaving the work area to satisfy the performance standard.</p><p>If exterior vertical containment is erected at a distance of less than ten feet from the work surface, the ground containment need not necessarily extend the full ten feet.

Specifically, HEPA exhaust control is not required when using a power drill to drill holes in sheetrock. When using a power drill with a drill bit to cut through sheetrock, the speed associated with the contact between the bit and the paint is not of the same magnitude as the contact speed generated by the machines identified in the regulation. The RRP Rule prohibits the use of machines designed to remove paint or other surface coatings through high speed operation such as sanding, grinding, power planning, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting, is prohibited on painted surfaces unless such machines have shrouds or containment systems and are equipped with a HEPA vacuum attachment to collect dust and debris at the point of generation.

      "a":"<p>The RRP Rule requires the renovation firm to use precautions to ensure that all personnel, tools, and other items are free of dust and debris before leaving the work area. Workers with contaminated clothing can take that contamination home to their own children, and taking contaminated equipment to another jobsite could potentially create a lead hazard at a new site. There are several ways of ensuring that gloves and other clothing are free of dust and debris before leaving the work area. For example, tacky mats may be put down immediately adjacent to the plastic sheeting covering the work area floor to remove dust and debris from the bottom of the workers’ shoes as they leave the work area. If workers wear shoe covers, they may remove them as they leave the work area. Clothing and materials may be wet-wiped and/or HEPA-vacuumed before they are removed from the work area. While the rule does not specifically address gloves, if they are contaminated with lead dust or debris that cannot be removed, EPA recommends that they not be removed from the work site during the job and that they be disposed of as part of final cleanup.</p>"

A HEPA filter is a filter that is capable of capturing particulates of 0.3 microns with 99.97% efficiency. The vacuum cleaner must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the HEPA filter with none of the air leaking past it. HEPA vacuums must be operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Therefore, renovation firms should look for a vacuum cleaner that was designed to be operated with a HEPA filter, rather than a shop vacuum that can be fitted with a HEPA filter in place of the original basic filter. A vacuum retrofitted with a HEPA filter is not necessarily properly sealed or designed so that all of the intake air goes through the HEPA filter. EPA also recommends that renovation firms ask the manufacturer or retailer whether the machine has been tested to ensure that it achieves the high efficiency required of a HEPA filter (capturing 99.97% of 0.3 micron particles).</p>"

      "a":"<p>With respect to landlords, EPA believes that there are two circumstances where work being done in pre-1978 apartment is for compensation such that the landlord must be a certified firm and use (or be) a certified renovator. First, if the landlord does the renovation him or herself, then the landlord must have firm and renovator certification. Second if an employee of the landlord does the renovation work, then the landlord must have firm certification and the employee must be a certified renovator. However, if the landlord hires a renovation firm to perform the renovation, the landlord does not need firm or renovator certification, but the firm hired by the landlord must be certified and must perform the renovation using a certified renovator that directs and provides on-the-job training to any workers that are not certified renovators.</p>"

Therefore, if the property management company uses its own employees to do the work, the property management company must be a certified firm and one of the employees must be a certified renovator. If the property management company hires a renovation firm to perform the renovation, the property management company does not need firm or renovator certification, but the firm the property management company hires must be certified and must perform the renovation using a certified renovator that directs and provides on-the-job training to any workers that are not certified renovators.</p>"

      "a":"<p>The RRP Rule applies to renovations performed for compensation. Compensation includes pay for work performed, such as that paid to contractors and subcontractors; wages, such as those paid to employees of contractors, building owners, property management companies, child-occupied facility operators, State and local government agencies, and non-profits; and rent for target housing or public or commercial building space. Donations, including donations of materials or of the time of volunteers, are not compensation. If the organization is compensating anyone for the work (for example, a paid supervisor), then the renovation is covered by the RRP Rule. This is the case even though the organization has non-profit or not-for-profit status.</p><p>The organization may also need to become certified as a firm. Beginning April 22, 2010, an organization that performs, offers, or claims to perform renovations covered by the RRP Rule must be certified by EPA. A non-profit organization that offers to renovate the property of a third party for compensation, or that performs the renovation, must be certified as a firm. The organization must comply with all the requirements of the rule that apply to firms performing renovations. This includes having a certified renovator direct the work and provide on-the-job training to all uncertified workers, including volunteers.</p>"

These sub-grantees fall into one of three categories:The sub-grantee uses its own employees to perform all the weatherization services in the home, The sub-grantee uses a combination of its own employees and contractors to perform weatherization services, or The sub-grantee has no employees that perform weatherization services; instead, every service is performed by a hired contractor. Must these sub-grantees be RRP-certified firms?",
      "a":"<p>Beginning April 22, 2010, no firm may perform, offer, or claim to perform renovations covered by the RRP Rule without certification from EPA. Sub-grantees that use their own employees to perform any or all of the weatherization services in the home, such as the sub-grantees in the first two categories, must be RRP certified firms.</p><p>As to the sub-grantee in the third category, the need for certification depends on whether the sub-grantee offers, through the grant proposal, to renovate the property of a specific homeowner or other third-party. In this case, the sub-grantee is an offeror and grant money is 'compensation” for RRP purposes. Once the offer is accepted (i.e., the grant is issued) a contract is formed under which the sub-grantee is obligated to perform the renovation. Even if the sub-grantee chooses to fulfill its obligation to perform the renovation by contracting out the work, the sub-grantee is 'offering to perform a renovation” for purposes of the RRP rule. Accordingly, the sub-grantee must be a certified firm and comply with all other applicable RRP requirements.</p><p>Conversely, if the sub-grantee does not 'perform, offer, or claim to perform” a renovation - through a grant proposal or otherwise - the sub-grantee need not be certified. For example, a grant proposal would not constitute an 'offer” if the issuance of the grant would not obligate the sub-grantee to renovate the property of a specific third-party. If the grant proposal is not a legally binding offer, the sub-grantee becomes a mere purchaser of renovation services when it uses the grant money to hire a renovation firm. In such a case, only the renovation firm – the offeror - must be certified</p>"

However, since conditions at the job site may be difficult to predict, EPA strongly recommends that all firms involved in the renovation be certified and use properly trained and certified personnel. For example, a firm hired to install an HVAC system after demolition of painted surfaces has taken place may find that to complete the job painted surfaces need to be disturbed. The HVAC firm may not engage in activities that disturb painted surfaces if it is not certified.</p><p>As every renovation job is different, it is up to the firm acting as the general contractor to determine what activities are within the scope of the renovation and to ensure that other firms are properly trained and certified for the tasks they will be performing. All firms, including the firm acting as the general contractor, are responsible for making sure the renovation is performed in accordance with the work practice standards, including keeping containment intact and making sure lead dust and debris do not leave the worksite. General contractors should keep in mind that if a firm hires a subcontractor that fails to follow the work practice standards or otherwise violates the RRP rule, the firm that hired the subcontractor is also responsible for the violation.</p>"

The amount of OJT needed and the topics that need to be covered depend on the knowledge and experience of each worker. OJT for a worker who has successfully completed prior EPA/HUD lead-safe work practices training, accredited abatement supervisor or worker training, or HUD’s Lead Maintenance course training, might not have to cover basic lead-safe work practices information. It likely would need to address project-specific information (such as the worker’s tasks on the job, the operation of new equipment the worker is to use, work area exit locations, and waste disposal locations), as well as any new lead-safe work practices information that was not covered in the worker’s course training and that is pertinent to the worker’s tasks.</p><p>The certified renovator is responsible for ensuring compliance with the work practice standards at all renovations to which he or she is assigned. The certified renovator is also responsible for preparing the records demonstrating that the renovation was conducted in compliance with the work practice standards, including the requirement to provide OJT to non-certified workers. The renovation firm must keep records showing what training was provided to workers. It would be advisable for the records to reflect any prior training non-certified workers had taken.</p>"

With respect to assigning a certified renovator who is responsible for any OJT and regularly directing workers who are not certified renovators, a firm acting as a general contractor may satisfy this requirement by hiring another certified firm that in turn assigns a certified renovator to the job.

      "a":"<p>While the homeowner may be performing the role of general contractor by hiring firms and organizing their work, the homeowner is not performing, offering, or claiming to perform a renovation and therefore does not need to be a certified firm. The firms hired by the homeowner to perform renovation tasks are responsible for complying with all aspects of the RRP Rule that are applicable to their work, including firm certification.

EPA recommends that training providers include the phrase 'photo exception” in the normal place for a picture. Further, training providers should use special coding when assigning Part 5 of the unique certificate number. See for example, R-I-56789-10-E0025. Part 5 ('E0025” in the example) represents the unique number assigned by the trainer. The number is sequential and will always begin with the letter E. The first number E0001 should be assigned to the first 'photo exception” student completing training in a given calendar year.

Cover floors and furniture that cannot be moved with heavy duty plastic and tape, and seal off doors and heating and cooling system vents; - Keep children, pregnant women, and pets out of the work area at all times; - Minimize dust during the project by using techniques that generate less dust, such as wet sanding or scraping, or using sanders or grinders that have HEPA vacuum attachments which capture the dust that is generated; and - Clean up thoroughly by using a HEPA vacuum and wet wiping to clean up dust and debris on surfaces and wet mopping the floors with plenty of rinse water before taking down plastic over doors, windows, and vents.</p><p>For more specific information on how to perform renovation, repair, and painting projects safely in your own home, go to <a href='http://www.epa.gov/lead'>www.epa.gov/lead</a>or call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD.</p>"

If I sand five square feet of paint on one wall on one day, and five square feet on a different wall in the same room on the next day, are both projects considered minor repair and maintenance?",
		"a": "<p>'Minor repair and maintenance' is defined in 40 CFR 745.83 as activities that disrupt less than 6 square feet or less of painted surface per room for interior activities or 20 square feet or less of painted surface for exterior activities where none of the work practices prohibited or restricted by § 745.85(a)(3) are used and where the work does not involve window replacement or demolition of painted surface areas.  Even if an entire window measures less than six square feet, the replacement of any size window is a renovation, not minor repair and maintenance, because it is specifically excluded from the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance.'  Similarly, because torch burning is prohibited by 745.85(a)(3), no activity involving torch burning can be considered minor repair and maintenance. For the purposes of the definition of 31minor repair and maintenance, EPA considers demolition to be an activity that removes or otherwise disrupts a painted component in a way that destroys or ruins the component.</p><p>The definition of 'minor repair and maintenance' provides some guidance on how to measure the surface disrupted: 'When removing painted components, or portions of painted components, the entire surface area removed is the amount of painted surface disturbed.' In other cases, when painted surfaces are being disturbed or disrupted, but not completely removed, the disrupted surface area is the area being actively disturbed. For example, when spot sanding to prepare a surface for painting, the area of the surface that was actually sanded is the surface area disrupted.</p><p>Finally, the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance' states that 'jobs, other than emergency renovations, performed in the same room within the same 30 days must be considered the same job for the purpose of determining whether the job is a minor repair and maintenance activity.' Therefore, sanding five square feet of paint in the same room on two different days within the same 30-day period  must be considered the same job, which would be a renovation because it does not meet the definition of 'minor repair and maintenance.'</p>"

		"a": "<p>Generally, a certified renovator using an EPA-recognized lead test kit must test each building component to be disturbed. The only exception to this requirement is when the components make up an integrated whole. In such a case, one or more component(s) may represent a system of components, unless it is obvious to the renovator that the components have been repainted or refinished separately.</p><p>A staircase, for example, is made up of numerous repeating components which can be grouped together as integrated wholes for testing purposes. For these purposes, staircase components can be grouped into the following integrated wholes: (1) treads and risers, (2)balustrades, (3) newel posts, (4) railing caps, and (5) stringers. A single individual staircase component (e.g., a baluster) may represent the remaining staircase components of the same group (i.e., the rest of the balustrades on the staircase) unless it is obvious to the renovator that the components have been repainted or refinished separately. Therefore, where an entire staircase is to be disturbed, EPA believes it will be necessary to test five surfaces: one tread or riser, one balustrade, one newel post, one railing cap, and one exposed stringer.   So long as it is not obvious that the components have been repainted or refinished separately, a negative test for lead-based paint on an individual staircase component in each of these groups would mean that a renovation on that particular staircase could be performed without regard to the RRP work practices.</p><p>EPA also believes it appropriate to apply the integrated whole concept to windows and doors. For testing purposes, window and door components can be grouped into the following integrated wholes: (1) the window or door assembly and (2) the window or door trim. Window assembly components include the sashes, stops, head, jambs, sill or stool, and trough; door assembly components include the door slab(s), jambs, head, sill and threshold. As a practical matter, it is likely that interior and exterior surfaces of window and door assemblies were repainted or refinished separately and should be tested separately. Therefore, where both the window/door assembly and trim will be disturbed (e.g., a full-frame window/door replacement), EPA believes that it will be necessary to test four surfaces: one interior window/door assembly component, one interior window/door trim, one exterior window/door assembly component, and one exterior window/door trim. However, if you only disturb paint on the interior or exterior of a window then you only need to test the assembly and trim on that side. If it is not obvious that the components have been repainted or refinished based paint on a component in each of these groups would mean that a renovation on that particular window or door could be performed without regard to the RRP work practices.</p><p>NOTE: Each window, door and staircase to be disturbed must be separately tested, even if in the same room. Also, negative testing results must still be documented in accordance with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 745.86(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 745.86(a) and (c). See also FQ 23002-18220.</p>"

Specifically, if the renovation firm was unable to comply with all of the requirements of the RRP Rule due to an emergency, the firm must document the nature of the emergency and the provisions of the rule that were not followed,in addition to the other rule provisions that must be documented for an emergency renovation. For example, if the firm did not post warning signs or remove or cover all objects in the work area, it should clearly state in its records that these activities were not followed due to the emergency. With regard to the record keeping checklist, the firm should leave unchecked each task that was not performed due to the emergency. The documentation of the nature of the emergency and the work practices that were not followed may be written as a notation on the checklist, for example, or otherwise recorded (e.g., by attaching it to the checklist).</p><p>Although the emergency provision exempts certain RRP work practices, firms should perform as many of these lead-safe work practices as possible when conducting activities that must be immediately undertaken to respond to the emergency. For example, if the firm can contain the work area and still address the emergency, it should do so. Once the urgent safety and public health hazards and threats of significant property damage have been attended to (e.g., when the wet drywall is removed in the above scenario) the emergency provision can no longer be utilized and any additional renovation activities would be subject to all the requirements of the rule.</p>"

To fulfill the requirement for providing timing information for the renovations, owners/managers/renovators may either list the expected starting and ending dates, or employ one of the other methods for meeting the timing requirements described below.</li><li>C) Bi-monthly Notices–Section 745.84(a) of the RRP Rule requires that notifications be given no more than 60 days before renovation activities begin.  To minimize the number of notices required, owners/managers/renovators may group all of the renovation activities expected to occur over a 60-day period into a single notice distributed bi-monthly (every other month). Renovation activities which were expected to occur within a given 60-day period, but which were canceled or postponed, would simply be addressed in the subsequent bimonthly notice. Including renovation notices in, or as an attachment to, a pre-existing newsletter is acceptable provided that the cover of the newsletter prominently indicates that lead-based paint renovation notices are contained in or attached to the newsletter.</li></ol><p>Descriptions of Renovation Timing--Section 745.84(b)(2) of the RRP Rule requires that notices contain the 'expected starting and ending dates' of the proposed common area renovations.  Although providing specific dates is preferable wherever possible, the Agency is aware that unexpected events or 49circumstances often result in delays and/or cancellations of planned renovation activities.  To provide sufficient flexibility without unduly compromising residents’ rights to information on the timing of renovations in common areas, owners/managers/renovators may employ the following terminology to address the following timing scenarios to avoid the needing to issue supplemental notices:</p><ul><li>– 'On or about'--acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs one week before or after the date given.</li><li>–'Early [insert month name]'–acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs during the first half of the specified month.</li><li>–'Late [insert month name]'-- acceptable when the expected starting or ending dates occurs during the second half of the specified month.</li><li>–'Ongoing for the 12-month period beginning [insert month name]'–acceptable when the renovation commences within 60 days of the issuance of the notice and continues throughout the 12-month period. If an interruption of more than 60 days occurs anytime after commencement of such activity, a new notice will be required before the activity may restart.</li><p>Descriptions of Renovation Ending Dates–Due to the inherent difficulties in estimating the duration of many renovation activities, owners/managers/renovators are encouraged to make allowances for unexpected delays when providing descriptions of ending days under Section 745.84(b)(2) of the RRP Rule. Any estimated ending date with a rational basis is acceptable.</p>"

		"a": "<p>The RRP Rule requires the renovation firm to use precautions to ensure that all personnel, tools, and other items are free of dust and debris before leaving the work area.Workers with contaminated clothing can take that contamination home to their own children, and taking contaminated equipment to another jobsite could potentially create a lead hazard at a new site.There are several ways of ensuring that gloves and other clothing are free of dust and debris before leaving the work area.For example, tacky mats may be put down immediately adjacent to the plastic sheeting covering the work area floor to remove dust and debris from the bottom of the workers' shoes as they leave the work area.If workers wear shoe covers, they may remove them as they leave the work area.Clothing and materials may be wet-wiped and/or HEPA-vacuumed before they are removed from the work area.While the rule does not specifically address gloves, if they are contaminated with lead dust or debris that cannot be removed, EPA recommends that they not be removed from the work site during the job and that they be disposed of as part of final cleanup.</p>"

OJT for a worker who has successfully completed prior EPA/HUD lead-safe work practices training, accredited abatement supervisor or worker training, or HUD’s Lead Maintenance course training, might not have to cover basic lead-safe work practices information.It likely would need to address project-specific information (such as the worker’s tasks on the job, the operation of new equipment the worker is to use, work area exit locations, and waste disposal locations), as well as any new lead-safe work practices information that was not covered in the worker’s course training and that is pertinent to the worker’s tasks.</p><p>The certified renovator is responsible for ensuring compliance with the work practice standards at all renovations to which he or she is assigned.The certified renovator is also responsible for preparing the records demonstrating that the renovation was conducted in compliance with the work practice standards, including the requirement to provide OJT to non-certified workers.The renovation firm must keep records showing what training was provided to workers.

The exemption would not apply to homeowners performing lead-based paint activities in a house they owned and rented out to others.Additionally, the exemption does not apply to a homeowner’s residence when there is a child with elevated blood lead levels occupying the house.This third criterion was added in response to public comments on the proposed rule.The restriction was intended to protect the most sensitive populations, children with elevated blood lead levels, from potential lead exposure during lead abatements conducted by untrained homeowners.Therefore,landlords would only be eligible for the exemption when they meet all of the above criteria. Example: Mr. Smith owns Houses A and B, lives in House A, and rents out House B. He would be eligible for the exemption under 40 CFR 745.220(b) if he abated House A and did not have a child with elevated blood lead levels living in House A.Mr. Smith would not be eligible for the exemption if he abated House B, because he and/or his immediate family are not residing in House B.

ASTM Standards are voluntary consensus standards developed after careful review by technical committees which generally include EPA and HUD staff.ASTM Standards relating to lead often reference EPA and HUD documents, just as EPA and HUD documents often reference appropriate ASTM Standards. Although EPA did not specifically list ASTM Standards by name in its list of documented methodologies at §745.227(a)(3), EPA considers ASTM Standards to be 'other equivalent methods'.For example, the ASTM has developed the following standards which apply to collection and analysis lead samples in paint, dust or soil: ASTM E1726, 'Standard Practice for Sample Digestion of soils for the Determination of Lead by Atomic Spectrometry.' ASTM E1727, 'Standard Practice for Field Collection of Soil Samples for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques.'

		"q": "Did the final TSCA section 403 rule say who may make a hazard determination?",
		"a": "<p>No.Although the TSCA section 403 rule defines a hazard determination, it did not specify who may make hazard determinations.The TSCA section 403 rule amended the work practice standards in 40 C.F.R. 745.227 by adding §745.227(h)-'Determinations,' which explains what constitutes lead-based paint, a paint-lead hazard,a dust-lead hazard, or a soil-lead hazard. The TSCA section 402 rule,which 98established the work practice standards in §745.227, already requires that a lead hazard screen or risk assessment be conducted by a certified risk assessor (§745.227(c)(1) or §745.227(d)(1),respectively) and that post-abatement clearance be conducted by a certified inspector or risk assessor (§745.227(e)(8)(i)). Therefore,when hazard determinations are made as part of lead hazard screens and risk assessments or when post-abatement clearance is conducted,these activities must be done by a certified individual following all of the appropriate work practice standards in §745.227.Likewise, when hazard determinations are made as part of activities under EPA’s Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule,these activities must be done by a certified individual following the appropriate work practices in §745.85.Further, EPA-authorized state programs may have different requirements, including additional requirements for hazard determinations.Therefore,it is important for individuals to review the specific regulations for the states where they will be working.Although EPA does not specify who may make a hazard determination, EPA does specify what constitutes a hazard determination. As part of the final TSCA section 403 rule EPA added §745.227(h) 'Determinations' which explains generally how to determine the presence of lead-based paint, paint-lead hazards, dust-lead hazards, and soil-lead hazards. These are the requirements for EPA’s Federal program.EPA-authorized state programs may address hazard determinations differently.When lead-based paint hazards are reported for any purposes,it will always be important to indicate the source of the data so that anyone to whom the information is being provided may consider the accuracy of the data when determining its significance.</p>"

		"q": "Must refresher course completion certificates for lead-based paint abatement certification bear an expiration date?",
		"a": "<p>No.The requirement that a completion certificate include an expiration date only applies to 'interim certifications.'Refresher course completion certificates do not expire in the Federal program. Specifically, 40 CFR 745.225(e)(4) and (e)(5)(vi), in describing requirements for refresher courses, refer back to 40 CFR 745.225(c),the requirements for initial course programs.However, 40 CFR 745.225(c)(8)(iv), which states that course completion certificates must bear the interim certification expiration date, does not apply to refresher course completion certificates.'Interim certification,' as that term is defined in 40 CFR 745.223,describes the status of a person who has successfully completed a training course but who has not yet received formal certification from EPA.The term is not applicable to persons who have already been certified.Accordingly, there is no interim certification date to display on a refresher course completion certificate.Moreover, 40 CFR 745.226(e) states that a certified person must be re-certified by EPA every three years,or every five years, if the person’s initial course included a proficiency test.Unlike the interim certification,which allows a person to work for up to six months before being fully certified,a certification of a person who has already been certified will expire on the applicable anniversary date(three or five years), unless they have taken the refresher course and been re-certified prior to the expiration of their current certification.There is no provision allowing this deadline to be extended (or shortened) based on the completion date of a refresher course. Imprinting a refresher course completion certificate with an expiration date six months from the date the certificate is issued could mislead certified individuals into thinking that they have six months from the date they complete their refresher course to become re-certified regardless of when their certification expires. This is incorrect and may cause a person’s certification to lapse. In addition, such an expiration date could also be misleading because it implies that a certified person must take a refresher course no more than six months before his or her current certification expires. EPA has no such requirement. On the contrary, EPA recommends that refresher training be taken more than 18 months before an individual’s current certification expires</p>"

		"a": "<p>Public water systems (PWSs) commonly add phosphates to the drinking water as a corrosion inhibitor to prevent the leaching of lead and copper from pipes and fixtures. Inorganic phosphates (e.g., phosphoric acid, zinc phosphate, and sodium phosphate) are added to the water to create orthophosphate, which forms a protective coating of insoluble mineral scale on the inside of service lines and household plumbing.The coating serves as a liner that keeps corrosion elements in water from dissolving some of the metal in the drinking water.The key to ensuring that orthophosphate reduces lead and copper levels is for PWSs to maintain proper orthophosphate levels.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a report on the toxicology of inorganic phosphates as food ingredients. The FDA considers phosphates as a food additive to be ''generally recognized as safe.''This report is available at: < a href = ''http: //www.journals.elsevier.com/food-and-chemical-toxicology>http://www.journals.elsevier.com/food-and-chemical-toxicology</a> .Also, NSF International maintainsrecommended maximum dosages of drinking water additives including phosphate products. The typical phosphate levels found in a liter of drinking water are about one hundred times lower than the phosphate levels found in the average American diet. For example, a personwould have to drink 10 to 15 liters of water to equal the amount of phosphates in just one can of soda. People concerned about their health and phosphates added as a corrosion inhibitor to the drinking water, should contact their medical care provider.</p>"
